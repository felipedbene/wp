# The AI Blogging Butler: Built with Amazon Q

This document captures how Amazon Q helped create "The AI Blogging Butler" - an automated WordPress post generator using Amazon Bedrock's Claude model.

## Project Overview

Amazon Q helped develop a sophisticated Python script that:

1. Fetches recent posts from a WordPress blog to understand the author's style
2. Analyzes their content using Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3 Sonnet model
3. Generates a new SEO-optimized post with similar style, tone, and humor
4. Automatically creates and embeds AI-generated images using Stable Diffusion XL
5. Publishes the complete post with proper tags and metadata

## Key Features Added by Amazon Q

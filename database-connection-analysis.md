## Database Connection Issue Analysis

After reviewing the Kubernetes configuration for the WordPress blog, there are a few potential issues that could cause database connection problems:

1. **Volume Configuration Mismatch**
   - A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is defined separately (`db-storage-mariadb-freakshow-0`)
   - The MariaDB StatefulSet has empty `volumeClaimTemplates: []`
   - The container has a volumeMount for `db-storage`, but there's no corresponding volume definition
   
   **Fix**: Either:
   - Move the PVC to `volumeClaimTemplates` section in the StatefulSet, or
   - Add a `volumes` section to the pod template referencing the existing PVC

2. **Password Special Characters**
   The database password contains emoji characters ("p@ssw0rd!üòµ‚Äçüí´"), which might cause issues with encoding or escaping in some environments.
   
   **Fix**: Consider using a simpler password without special Unicode characters.

3. **Container Readiness**
   There are no readiness/liveness probes defined for the MariaDB container, which means Kubernetes might not accurately know when the database is ready to accept connections.

Recommended configuration changes:

```yaml
# Option 1: Using volumeClaimTemplates (recommended for StatefulSets)
spec:
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: db-storage
      spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        storageClassName: longhorn
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 7Gi

# Option 2: Using volumes in pod template
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: db-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: db-storage-mariadb-freakshow-0
```

Steps to resolve:
1. Implement one of the volume configuration fixes above
2. Consider changing the password to avoid special characters
3. Restart the StatefulSet after making changes
4. Check the pod events and logs for any startup issues
5. Verify the PVC is properly bound and mounted

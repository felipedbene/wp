## WordPress REST API Migration
Consider migrating from XML-RPC to WordPress REST API for better compatibility with newer Python versions:

1. Replace `wordpress-xmlrpc` library with `requests` to interact with WordPress REST API
2. Use application passwords or OAuth for authentication
3. Update endpoints:
   - `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts` for fetching posts
   - `POST /wp-json/wp/v2/posts` for creating posts
   - `POST /wp-json/wp/v2/media` for uploading images

Benefits:
- Better maintained and actively developed
- More secure (XML-RPC has security vulnerabilities)
- Better performance with lower overhead
- More comprehensive feature set
- No compatibility issues with newer Python versions

## Other Potential Enhancements
- Analytics integration to track post performance
- Topic suggestion based on trending keywords
- Comment moderation and response generation
- Support for multiple WordPress sites
- Content scheduling based on optimal posting times
